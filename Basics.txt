LESSON 1 - BLOCKCHAIN BASICS

    Bitcoin allowed peer to peer transactions on this decentralized network and offered a superior store of value (gold); created by Satoshi Nakamoto
        Built on cryptography and decentralization
        Scarce amount

    Building on this technology, Ethereum was created allowing for more interaction, through smart contracts; created by Vitalik Buterin

        *Nick Szabo originally created smart contracts in 1994
        Smart contracts - set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized party
            They exist and are executed on blockchains, as opposed to between centralized authorities
        Store of value AND smart contracts

    The Oracle Problem - blockchains cannot interact with real world data; blockchains are deterministic systems
        Blockchain Oracles - device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts
            https://betterprogramming.pub/what-is-a-blockchain-oracle-f5ccab8dbd72 
            We cannot have a single centralized Oracle system, we need an Oracle Network that is also decentralized
                This results in Hybrid Smart Contracts (on-chain + off-chain agreements)
                    https://blog.chain.link/hybrid-smart-contracts-explained/ 
                    Ex. Chainlink - the most popular Decentralized Oracle Network

    Web1 - permissionless open sourced web with static content; read
        Web2 - permissioned web, with dynamic content, where companies run your agreements on their servers; read + write
            Web3 - permissionless web, with dynamic content, where decentralized censorship resistant networks run your agreement and code.  User-owned ecosystems; read + write + ownership

    What is the value of smart contracts?  What problems do they solve?
        they create Trusted Minimized Agreements (unbreakable promises)
            the world is run on agreements; promises
        they are immutable, decentralized, and transparent
