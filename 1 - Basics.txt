LESSON 1 - BASICS

    A. Bitcoin allowed peer to peer transactions on a decentralized network and offered a superior store of value (gold)
        created by Satoshi Nakamoto
        built on cryptography and decentralization
        scarce amount
        Bitcoin whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
        Blockchain: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

    B. Building on this technology, Ethereum was created allowing for more interaction, through 'smart contracts'
        created by Vitalik Buterin
        Ethereum whitepaper: https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/
        *Nick Szabo originally created smart contracts in 1994
        'smart contracts' - set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized party
            they exist and are executed on blockchains, as opposed to between centralized authorities
        Ethereum = store of value + smart contracts

    C. The Oracle Problem - blockchains cannot interact with real world data; blockchains are deterministic systems
        Blockchain Oracles - device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts
            https://betterprogramming.pub/what-is-a-blockchain-oracle-f5ccab8dbd72 
            we cannot have a single centralized Oracle system, we need an Oracle Network that is also decentralized
                on-chain logic, yes is decentralized, but we also need our off-chain data computation to also be decentralized
                    this results in Hybrid Smart Contracts (on-chain + off-chain agreements)
                        https://blog.chain.link/hybrid-smart-contracts-explained/ 
                        Ex. Chainlink - the most popular Decentralized Oracle Network and it blockchain agnostic

    D. 
    Web1 - permissionless open sourced web with static content; read
        Web2 - permissioned web, with dynamic content, where companies (centralized) run your agreements on their servers; read + write
            Web3 - permissionless web, with dynamic content, where decentralized censorship resistant networks run your agreement and code.  User-owned ecosystems; read + write + ownership

    E. What is the value of smart contracts?  What problems do they solve?
        they create Trusted Minimized Agreements (unbreakable promises)
            the world is run on agreements; promises
        it is an agreement, contract, or set of instructions that are deployed on a decentralized blockchain
            they are immutable (+secure), decentralized, and transparent
            move from paper (brand-based) guarantees to cryptographic (math-based) guarantees
        examples:
            DeFi - gives the ability of users to engage with finance without having to go through a centralized intermediary

                https://medium.com/the-capital/why-defi-1519cc4d4bd3
            DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) - group governed by a transparent set of rules defined within a smart contract

            NFT - unique assets

        Etherscan - block explorer for Ethereum
            https://etherscan.io/
        Accounts:
            each account has a unique Public key and Private key
                *Private key gives you full access to that given account

            Secret Recovery Phase - key that gives you access to all accounts within your wallet
                allows us to create 1+ accounts

        Networks - we have the 'Ethereum Mainnet' where actual transactions live and then we have additional test networks that allow us to test transactions using fake money
